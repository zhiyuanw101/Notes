## [`extern` keyword](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/understanding-extern-keyword-in-c/)
---
```c
 int foo(int arg1, char arg2);
```
is viewed as:
```c
 extern int foo(int arg1, char arg2);
```
``extern`` extend the function visibility to any files in the whole program (with declaration of the function)

## Dclaration and definition
---
- A declaration can be done any number of times but definition only once.
- Declare: no memory assigned
- Define: declare and has memory
- When `extern` is used with a variable, itâ€™s only declared, not defined (if not init with value).

## Symbol table and relocation table
---
Symbol table: deals with globals(static)
- global labels (Text, Data), and undefined global symbolic addresses (Undefined).

Relocation table: deals with call to memory
- all symbolic address (both data and text), for load/store, branch.
